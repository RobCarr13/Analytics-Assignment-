We had to find the optimum plant and port for a production location in order to minimize road transportation costs.
Firstly I found the nearest port to each production location. I did this using the haversine function and then a simple function to add the nearest port to each production plant to a list. I assumed that the production tonnes of raw materials would have to be transported to the plant so I looked at how many trips this would take assuming they used a lorry that contained maximum of 44 tonnes. (www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn00654.pdf) So i divided the total amount of production in tonnes by 44 to see how many trips would be needed from the plant to the port (I also assumed that the company hire someone to transport the production material and hence I therefore assumed that the distance travelled would be one way). For each value in the list I multiplied it by the amount of trips needed i.e. total production tonnes/44.0. Now I calculated the distance from one port to all the other ports. I did this by getting the distance from plant 1 for example to plant 2 and multiplying this answer by the amount of tonnes of product at plant 2 over 44.0. I then did this for the rest of the plants, ie plant 1 to plant 3, plant 1 to plant 4 etc. and then totaled this up. I did the same for the rest of the plants. I then added the figure for each plant by their respective amount of travel needed to their nearest port. This showed that plant 5 was the optimum solution using Port 3.
